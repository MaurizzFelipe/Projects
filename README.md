# Data Eng project

A project that shows how one could extract data from a data source and distribute this data to a stakeholder by developing an analytical dashboard.

## Overview

- Extract data from some source -- In this project we will cover how to get data from aws S3 and another approach using pyspark
- Dump the data into a SQL managment tool where the B.I analysts can use to develop data analysis
- Develop a dashboard connecting the databases we have created

Her1e you want to write a short overview of the goals of your project and how it works at a high level. If possible, include one or two images of the end product and architecture diagram (see examples below). diagrams.net is a great tool for creating architecture diagrams.

### Data Visualization

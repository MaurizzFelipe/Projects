# Data Eng project

A project that shows how one could extract data from a data source and distribute this data to a stakeholder by developing an analytical dashboard.
We will focus only on getting data beyond the external data source, so we are assuming that you already have a data process that dumps data into AWS S3 buckets.
You can use fake data to practice the process.

## Overview
Steps that we will see:

### - How to dump and Extract data from some source -- In this project we will cover how to get dump and get data from aws S3 and another approach using pyspark

### - Dump the data into a SQL managment tool where the B.I analysts can use to develop data analysis -- we can use redshift managment tool and a python approach to dump data into postgresql
  
### - Connect the databases we Develop and create a dashboard with the data to understand data patterns.

This is just a simplified chart that illustrate what tools we will cover

Her1e you want to write a short overview of the goals of your project and how it works at a high level. If possible, include one or two images of the end product and architecture diagram (see examples below). diagrams.net is a great tool for creating architecture diagrams.

### Data Visualization

### Data Architecture

If you decide to include this, you should also talk a bit about why you chose the architecture and tools you did for this project.

## How to Run This Project

Replace the example step-by-step instructions with your own.

1. Install x packages
2. Run command: `python x`
3. Make sure it's running properly by checking z
4. To clean up at the end, run script: `python cleanup.py`

## Lessons Learned

It's good to reflect on what you learned throughout the process of building this project. Here you might discuss what you would have done differently if you had more time/money/data. Did you end up choosing the right tools or would you try something else next time?
